It's time to resume my blog. At the moment I'm working in Windows environement and I found these two articles really helpful for me:

- How to install Octopress on Windows http://thaiat.github.io/blog/2014/03/13/how-to-install-and-use-octopress-on-windows/
- How to connect to an existing blog http://blog.zerosharp.com/clone-your-octopress-to-blog-from-two-places/
